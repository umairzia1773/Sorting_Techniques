# Sorting_Techniques

#Bubble sort : is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Selection sort is a simple in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted. 
It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves. 
It uses the merge subroutine to merge the two halves into a single sorted list.

These are just a few examples of sorting algorithms implemented in Python. There are many other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, etc., 
each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and stability.
