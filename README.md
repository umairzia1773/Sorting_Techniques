# Sorting_Techniques

Bubble sort
--
it is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Selection sort
--
It is a in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted. 
It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Merge sort
--
It is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input list into two halves, recursively sorts the two halves, and then merges the sorted halves. 
It uses the merge subroutine to merge the two halves into a single sorted list.

Insertion sort 
--
It is a sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It iterates through the input list, shifting elements as necessary to insert each element into its correct position.
